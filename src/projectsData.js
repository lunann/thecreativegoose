        description: "36 days of type is a project to encourage designers to design letters and numbers from the latin alphabet. For 36 days you come up with a innovate design for a letter or number for that specific day and then showcase it on Instagram. I decided to participate as I wanted to develop as a designer and thought this was a fun way to do it. While doing the project I got a routine which helped me think more creative and innovative and I ended up doing all the 26 letters and 10 numbers.",
        detail: "I wanted to have a cohesive collection and therefore decided to use the same colours and style for each design. The design works a lot with overlayering and different forms. This resulted in these designs that are some of my favourites.",

        description: "In the middle of June 2018 I got a place as head of marketing in the vegan association at Linköping University. The association had only been around for a few years and was in the process of a new website to reach out to more people. My goal was to make an easy design as this was my first ever design job and I therefore didn’t want to try to do more than I could accomplish. This resulted in a five page website with the information needed to read more about the association and how to get involved.",
