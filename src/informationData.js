        infoText: "My name is Annika Lundberg, I’m a 23 year old girl from what is known as the ugliest city in Sweden, Borlänge. This didn’t affect me more than I new at a very young age that I wanted to move to a more lively city. At the age of 19 I therefore moved away from home to start studying engineering in the beautiful city Norrköping in Sweden with the campus laying right next to the river floating through the city. Though it was a beautiful city, engineering wasn’t for me, and I decided to move to the near city Linköping to study Cognitive Science. With a wonderful student life I have now found my place and will in the autumn start my last year to become a frontend developer.",
        infoLove: "I love when things are happening around me and when I have a busy schedule. During me student life I have therefore engaged in different association that have the similar interest as me. I’ve been a part of a vegan association as a result for my almost 4 years of vegan and I have also been a part of Erasmus Student Network because of my love for different cultures. When I’m not studying or working I love to hang at cozy bars with friends, play board games or travel.",
