This didn’t affect me more than I new that I wanted to move to a more colourfull and lively city. At the age of 19 I therefore moved away from home to start studying engineering in the beautiful city Norrköping. Though it was a beautiful city, engineering wasn’t for me, and I decided to move to the near city Linköping to study Cognitive Science. With a lively student life I have now found my place and will in the autumn start my last year to become a frontend developer.",

        infoLove: "I’m a web developer that focus on minimalistic design and works a lot with contrast and forms. Typography and placement of different objects can create an impact even though keeping the design simple, and this is what I strive to achieve when creating new content. In my designs I also try to avoid to use the colour black more than needed because I believe life is too colorful to not use it. A business has an identity and no business is the other alike, I therefore always create unique websites and not from any templates to make you represent what you and your company stand for.",
